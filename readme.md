Interactive evolution of svg images using Raphael

ToDo
----

- Pretty CSS to make individuals smaller
- Divisions for generations
- Sexual Reproduction via swpap
- Consider compacting z-indices if possible
- Make cost function weighing of extra circles explicit


Ideas
-----

- allow other shapes?
-


Notes
-----

- Stopped using transparencies because the canvg library wasn't rendering them
  in such a way that the cost function worked
- Palette choosing could be interactive, or at least display its process
